# MateoNicoudPortfolio

MateoNicoudPortfolio is a complete revamp of my previous portfolio website, which was originally created in December 2023 using HTML, CSS, and a dash of Bootstrap. The old site can still be accessed at [https://mateonicoud.github.io/](https://mateonicoud.github.io/).

The new iteration, now accessible at [https://www.mateonicoud.site/](https://www.mateonicoud.site/), is entirely crafted using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The only external dependency utilized is WebKit for card rendering. This redesign focuses on enhancing performance, accessibility, and responsiveness, resulting in a commendable Lighthouse score.

## Key Features

- Pure vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS implementation
- Responsive design for seamless browsing across devices
- WebKit integration for optimized card display
- Impressive Lighthouse score for performance and accessibility

## JavaScript Animations

The site features several JavaScript animations, including:

- Parallax scrolling effect for a more immersive user experience
- Opacity changes on scroll for the scroll down icon
- Intersection Observer API used to animate elements on scroll, making them appear with a slide-up effect
- Card flip animations for an interactive display of skills

## Acknowledgments
